title: The Night of Sevens
---
<p>
The cruel, <i><span style="font-family: 'Libertinus Sans'; font-size: 120%; font-style: italic; color: #f59ba9">amorous</span></i> flow of time pours itself into<br>
The mountains and seas that separate us.<br>
How sublime, the static tides of <span style="color: #94e59a">emeralds</span> and<br>
The horizontal cliffs of <span style="color: #79b0f9">sapphires</span>!<br>
How sad, all but obstacles they are for the tiny <span style="color: #b2beff">pearls</span><br>
I sent on the way to you!
</p>
<p>
  Yet be they pearls, the softness of their sheen lures the night<br>
  Into their warm embrace, my longing gaze; mingled into<br>
  The stream of Sevens, it permeates the dense rounds of<br>
  Erratic dances of symbols that circle your fatigued soul.<br>
  When our eyes meet, they whisper to each other silently:<br>
  Carry on, as my <span style="font-family: 'Libertinus Sans'; font-size: 120%; font-style: italic; color: #f59ba9">love</span> has always and will forever.
  <br>
