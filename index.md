# Haoming Li
I'm a first year Ph.D. student in linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I received B.A. in Linguistics from the University of Chicago in 2022.

My main areas of interest are syntax, semantics, and their interface. I focus on Mandarin Chinese as the language of study for its richness in quantificational dependencies and flexible clause structures.

Specific topics I have covered include:
- Across-the-Board constructions
- *Wh*-questions
- Comparatives
- Modals
