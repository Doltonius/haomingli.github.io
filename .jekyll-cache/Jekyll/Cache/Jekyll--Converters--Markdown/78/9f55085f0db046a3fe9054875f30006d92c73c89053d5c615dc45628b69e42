<p>Iâ€™m a first year Ph.D. student in linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I received BA in Linguistics from the University of Chicago in 2022.</p>

<p>My main areas of interest are syntax, semantics, and their interface. I focus on Mandarin Chinese as the language of study for its richness in quantificational dependencies and flexible clause structures.</p>
