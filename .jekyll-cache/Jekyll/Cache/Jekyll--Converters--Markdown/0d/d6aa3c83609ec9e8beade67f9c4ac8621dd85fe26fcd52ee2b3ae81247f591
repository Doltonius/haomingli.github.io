<p>Iâ€™m a first year Ph.D. student in linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My main areas of interest are syntax, semantics, and their interface. I focus on Mandarin Chinese as the language of study for its richness in quantificational dependencies and flexible clause structures. hhhh</p>
